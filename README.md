# Time Series Analysis of Stock Market Prices

This project explores **time-series forecasting** of stock prices using
four approaches:

- **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** (Statsmodels)
- **Prophet** (Meta/Facebook)
- **LSTM** (TensorFlow/Keras)

## Data
Historical stock data retrieved from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) via the `yfinance` API.

## Workflow
1. Download and clean stock price data.
2. Perform exploratory analysis and visualization.
3. Train and evaluate each forecasting model.
4. Compare accuracy using RMSE and MAE.
5. Deploy interactive dashboard with **Streamlit**.
